# Family Friday - Random Lunch Group Generator

This is an implementation of the lunch group lottery. It takes a list of employees and randomly assigns them to groups of 3-5 people. New Hires can also be added to the list. 

The list of employees are stored and hosted on Glitch.com [See project here](https://glitch.com/~moored-shark)
